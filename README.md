# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my **personal portfolio website**, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and styled with Tailwind CSS.  
I created this site to **showcase my projects, skills, and experiences** as a software developer.

The project structure is based on [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with the App Router setup.

### âœ¨ Highlights
- Designed and developed from scratch using Next.js
- Used **AI and LLM tools** (like ChatGPT) to refine UI/UX, generate content ideas, and optimize styling
- Live preview available at:
